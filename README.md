# GameNews
Welcome to the Game News Game! The gem that will get you the top headlines provided to you each day from Kotaku.com. 
 This application scrapes the top story headlines from Kotaku.com. Kotaku is a website for video game reviews, news, tips, and a source for other gaming related media. I designed my application to begin by display a list of all the top headlines on Kotaku’s homepage along with the author and url. The application then asks the user to input the number of the headline that they would like more information about. The next level of the CLI will then display the headline, author, url and story type that corresponds to the user’s choice. 

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'GameNews'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install GameNews
